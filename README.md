# Site React Express 1

## Project Purpose
The **Site React Express 1** project marks an important step in my web development journey, marking my first experience with **React** and **Express**. This project was created at the request of my father for his business. After working on several **C language** projects at my school (42), this project allowed me to diversify my skills, embrace new technologies, and step back from the routine of working exclusively with C.

With no prior experience in React or Express, I took on this project to explore new horizons and broaden my skill set.

## Key Takeaways
Through this project, I was able to:
- Learn to design a **responsive website**.
- Familiarize myself with **backend development** through an initial, simple approach using **Express**.
- Rediscover **JavaScript** while learning the basics of **React**, **Express**, and **JSX**.
  
This project has been a learning exercise, and there are still many areas left to explore to deepen my knowledge of these technologies. Iâ€™ve only scratched the surface of what React and Express can offer, but I have gained a strong foundation to continue progressing.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: for creating the user interface and adding interactivity to the site.
- **Express**: for server-side development and handling backend requests.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: as the main language for front-end and back-end logic.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: for responsive design and structuring the site.

## Features
- Responsive site that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Simple navigation with a separated front-end/back-end architecture.
- Basic backend handling requests via Express.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # In the server folder
   cd server
   npm install

   # In the client folder
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

4. **Start the client**:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (default).

## Conclusion
This project is an introductory step into the world of full-stack web development. It serves as a foundation for further exploring and expanding the use of **React** and **Express** and diving into more advanced features of these technologies.
